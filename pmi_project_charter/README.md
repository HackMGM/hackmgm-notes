    To All:

    The attached document is the initial revision of the project charter that has been so wonderfully provided to us by Sir Eric Pierce and his PMI cohorts.  Please feel free to review the details and provide any feedback for which you have been inspired to provide.  I am hoping to have this item submitted to our Github depository over the next day or so as a means of tracking input from everyone.  Shucks, one could argue that this was the primary reason for Torvalds beginning the development of git (along with the fact that the owner of the Bitkeeper platform started exhibiting interesting postures towards his software's licensing.   8^)   )

    Thank you all much for your time.
