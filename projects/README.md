Project Ideas:

* Central Montgomery Optimist Club website
* Clefworks (executive director seemed interested)

Web/Mobile apps:
* a reservation app for Ampersand. And perhaps we could reuse it for the city by making it available for reserving picnic pavilions or other spaces (or if not reserving at least being able to scan a QR code to see what days it is already reserved).
